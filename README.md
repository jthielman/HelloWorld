# HelloWorld
This is the first exercise of the back end portion of my web development bootcamp.
It asks which dialect is preferred, offers a greeting according to the user's choice, asks the user's name, greets the user by name, then lists some animal names.  Then it asks for the user's favorite color, whereupon it asks whether the user would like a randomly chosen animal of that color.
That's about it.
